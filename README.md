"Ordinary Differencial Equation Solver - Van Der Pol Oscillator"


Back in '20s, Balthasar Van der Pol, a bivalent physicist known by his
theoretical and experimental skills, realized some experiments of eletronic
circuits using triodes. One of them is called Van Der Pol's Oscillator and
is discribed by diferencial equations, which for e=1 it shows a simple
harmonical oscillator, but in different cases the harmonicity deviates to a
non-linear shape.
